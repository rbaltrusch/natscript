# Natscript Interpreter

This is an interpreter written in Python for a custom interpreted language, Natscript, which is to be very close to natural English. It is currently still in development and supports very little functionality, but will receive more over time.

## Getting started

To get a copy of this repository, simply open up git bash in an empty folder and use the command:

		$ git clone https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter

To run the interpreter, run interpreter/main.py. At the moment, it is configured to only parse in and interpret file contents, rather than an interactive console.

## Documentation

### Available functionality

A list of the currently available Natscript commands will be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter/wiki).

Available functionality includes variables, conditionals, function and lambda definitions, as well as scope and nesting.

### Examples

Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter/tree/main/examples).

### Tutorials

Tutorials will be written once more commands are supported by Natscript.

## Python

Written in Python 3.8.3.

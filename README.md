Python Interpreter for custom interpreted language, Natscript, which is to be very close to natural English.

To try out the current interpreter configuration, run interpreter/main.py. Note that test.nat is not provided anymore and needs to be provided by the user, written with the available commands. A list of the currently available Natscript commands can be found in the Wiki (soon).

Written in Python 3.8.3

# Natscript Interpreter

This is an interpreter written in Python for a custom interpreted language, Natscript, which is to be very close to natural English. It is currently still in development and supports very little functionality, but will receive more over time.

## Getting started

To get a copy of this repository, simply open up git bash in an empty folder and use the command:

		$ git clone https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter

To run the interpreter, run interpreter/main.py. At the moment, it is configured to only parse in and interpret file contents, rather than an interactive console.

## Available commands

A list of the currently available Natscript commands can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/rbaltrusch/python_interpreter/wiki).

## Python

Written in Python 3.8.3
